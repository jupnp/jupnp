/**
 * Service for receiving TCP (HTTP) streams, one per bound IP address.
 * <p>
 * This service typically listens on a socket for TCP connections.
 * <p>
 * This listening loop is started with the <code>run()</code> method, this service is
 * <code>Runnable</code>. Then {@link Router#received(UpnpStream)} is called with a custom
 * {@link UpnpStream}. This will start processing of the request and <code>run()</code> the
 * {@link UpnpStream} (which is also <code>Runnable</code>) in a separate thread,
 * freeing up the receiving thread immediately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link UpnpStream} then creates a {@link org.jupnp.model.message.StreamRequestMessage}
 * and calls the {@link UpnpStream#process(org.jupnp.model.message.StreamRequestMessage)}
 * method. The {@link UpnpStream} then returns the response to the network client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In pseudo-code:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MyStreamServer implements StreamServer {
 *      run() {
 *          while (not stopped) {
 *              Connection con = listenToSocketAndBlock();
 *              router.received( new MyUpnpStream(con) );
 *          }
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * MyUpnpStream(con) extends UpnpStream {
 *      run() {
 *          try {
 *              StreamRequestMessage request = // ... Read request
 *              StreamResponseMessage response = process(request);
 *              // ... Send response
 *              responseSent(response))
 *          } catch (Exception e) {
 *              responseException(e);
